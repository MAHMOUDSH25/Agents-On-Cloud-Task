*NOTES ON FRONTEND:*
1) *TASK1* I did the Login and the sighnup screen 

2) *TASK2* I created a page to let the user to add a new product/item, the user can 
    enter the product's name, description and the image of the product/item (please uploade an image that is less than 7MB).

3) when you enter the *Home Screen* after you login or signup please do refresh the *Home Screen* because it needs to be refreshed in order to see all products (it is a bug but I couldn't find it but refreshing the page only once solves the issue).

4) *TASK3* I made the EDIT or DELETE task but it only works in *NodeMon* I coudn't make it in the frontEnd because I didn't know how to make it's code I have a little gap in my knowledge.

5) *TASK4* I did the View all items code so it works very good but as I said you just need to refresh the page please.

6) *TASK5* As for task 5 I couldn't do it becouse I couldn't make the full code for it so it wasn't 100% done.

*For the Front-end you can run it using (npm run start)*


*NOTES ON BACKEND:*

2) I did the Product/User Routes.

3) I did the server page.


*For the Back-end you can run it using (npm run start-dev)*
